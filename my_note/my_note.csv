11|https://www.linkedin.com/learning/end-to-end-data-engineering-project/initiating-your-dbt-project?resume=false|after active virtual environment venv, use command "call venv.bat"(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYr9qwW48uw) to run the bat file to run to setup environment variables instead of manually running 1 by 1 each time you active the environment. Another approach is that you can update the above activate.bat (Note that this activate.bat is being ignored from pushing into git repository) so that you do not need to run the above command "call venv.bat" seperatedly. Another approach is that you can use "setx" to instead of "set" for the command "set" of venv.bat to setup environment variables at systematic Windows 10 level which applying into all environments (Note that it will overwrite the existing ones) (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13222724/command-line-to-remove-an-environment-variable-from-the-os-level-configuration)
